### Processing Scripts (PyQGIS) by Ghassen Aouinti

- **extract_zip_file.py**

   Use this script to extract a zip file (shapefile zip or other) to a passed folder in parameter. Handy when you need to download a shapefile in a zip format, extract it for future processing and especially when you wand to intergrate this step in a QGIS modeler pipeline process.
